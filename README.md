# Page-Ranking
PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank websites in their search engine results. PageRank was named after Larry Page, one of the founders of Google. PageRank is a way of measuring the importance of website pages. According to Google:  "PageRank works by counting the number and quality of links to a page to determine a rough estimate of how important the website is. The underlying assumption is that more important websites are likely to receive more links from other websites." So, i develop an algorithm using c++ please enjoy                                               

======= Instraction =========
1. write your page links using 2x2 array format inside "inputFile.txt" file, then
2. Compile the "main.cpp" file and execute it. Finally,
3. You will get the output on the console and inside "outputFile.txt" in detail. 

tips=> you also get samples input inside "Other sample inputs.txt". So, you can copy it and paste (to minimite time) inside "inputFile.txt". thanks!
